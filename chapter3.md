# Patterns for implementing identity and access management for cloud users

## Self Registration	
* AWS provides sign up of free accounts and consolidated billing option to register for the cloud services - aws.amazon.com/free. 
* Azure free account and “Pay as you go“ sign up  https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/
* GCP free trial registration link - https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial
( IBM Cloud free account - https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/free 

## Federation
